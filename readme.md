# Machine Learning Practicals Repository

Welcome to my machine learning practicals repository! This repository is dedicated to storing the experiments and projects I work on as part of my university machine learning coursework.

## Experiment 1: Perceptron Binary Classification

### Overview
In this experiment, I implemented a Perceptron algorithm for binary classification. The Perceptron is a fundamental building block in the field of machine learning, and this experiment serves as a starting point for understanding its functionality and applications.

### Files
- [Perceptron.ipynb](./Perceptron_BinaryClassifier/Perceptron_BinaryClassifier.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Perceptron algorithm.
- [Sklearn make_classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_classification.html): Sample dataset used for training and testing the Perceptron.

### Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Perceptron_Binary_Classification` folder.
3. Run the [Perceptron.ipynb](./Perceptron_BinaryClassifier/Perceptron_BinaryClassifier.ipynb) script to train and test the Perceptron on the provided dataset.
4. Experiment with different parameters and datasets to gain a deeper understanding of the Perceptron's behavior.
